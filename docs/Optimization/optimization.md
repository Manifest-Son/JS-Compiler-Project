## Overview

Compiler performance is critical for providing a responsive development experience. Our compiler is designed with optimization in mind across all stages of the compilation pipeline.

### Performance Metrics

The compiler currently tracks two primary metrics:
- **Time complexity**: Measured in microseconds for processing input
- **Space complexity**: Measured as memory usage in KB

As shown in `main.cpp`:
```cpp
// Record start time and memory
auto start_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
size_t memory_before = getCurrentMemoryUsage();

// ... compilation process ...

// Calculate and display execution time
auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end_time - start_time).count();
std::cout << "Execution Time: " << duration << " microseconds" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Memory Usage: " << (memory_after - memory_before) << " KB" << std::endl;
```

## Lexical Analysis Optimizations

### Time Complexity Optimizations

1. **Character-by-Character Processing**
   - The lexer reads input once, with O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the input

2. **Efficient Token Recognition**
   - Use jump tables or lookup maps instead of long if-else chains for token type determination
   - Implement specialized methods for common token types

```cpp
// Optimized example:
std::unordered_map<std::string, TokenType> KEYWORDS = {
    {"let", KEYWORD},
    {"if", KEYWORD},
    // ...other keywords
};

// Fast lookup instead of multiple string comparisons
auto it = KEYWORDS.find(lexeme);
if (it != KEYWORDS.end()) {
    return Token(it->second, lexeme, line, lexeme);
}
```

3. **Minimizing Backtracking**
   - Design the lexer to avoid backtracking where possible
   - Use lookahead with `peek()` rather than advancing and then retreating

### Space Complexity Optimizations

1. **Token Storage Efficiency**
   - Use string views instead of copying strings when possible
   - Consider interning common strings (keywords, frequent identifiers)

2. **Buffer Management**
   - Use a sliding window approach for very large files instead of loading the entire file
   - Consider memory-mapped files for extremely large inputs

3. **Token Stream Compression**
   - For tokens with predictable patterns, consider using a more compact representation

## Parsing Optimizations

### Time Complexity Optimizations

1. **Recursive Descent Efficiency**
   - Optimize the recursive descent parser to minimize stack depth
   - Consider tail call optimization where applicable

2. **Predictive Parsing**
   - Use lookahead tokens effectively to reduce backtracking
   - Implement error recovery to prevent cascading failures

3. **Grammar Restructuring**
   - Analyze and restructure grammar rules to eliminate left recursion
   - Use operator precedence parsing for expressions

### Space Complexity Optimizations

1. **AST Node Pooling**
   - Implement object pooling for common AST node types
   - Reuse node objects when possible during parsing

2. **Shared Data Structures**
   - Use flyweight pattern for repeating elements like operator nodes
   - Share string data across nodes when possible

3. **Lazy Parsing**
   - Consider parsing only what's needed (useful for incremental compilation)
   - Defer full parsing of function bodies until needed

## AST Optimizations

### Tree Transformation Optimizations

1. **Constant Folding**
   - Evaluate constant expressions at compile time
   - Replace variable expressions with constants when values are known

2. **Tree Pruning**
   - Remove unreachable code
   - Eliminate redundant or no-op expressions

3. **Expression Simplification**
   - Apply algebraic simplifications (e.g., `x * 1` â†’ `x`)
   - Combine nested operations when possible

### AST Structure Optimizations

1. **Node Compression**
   - Use more compact representations for common patterns
   - Merge nodes where semantically equivalent

2. **Visitor Pattern Efficiency**
   - Optimize visitor pattern implementations for AST traversal
   - Consider specialized visitors for common operations

3. **AST Serialization**
   - Implement efficient serialization for caching parsed results
   - Use binary formats instead of text-based representations for internal storage

## Memory Management

### Allocation Strategies

1. **Custom Allocators**
   - Implement arena/region-based allocation for AST nodes
   - Use bump allocation for nodes with same lifetime

```cpp
// Example of a simple arena allocator
class NodeArena {
private:
    char* memory;
    size_t size;
    size_t used;

public:
    NodeArena(size_t size) : size(size), used(0) {
        memory = new char[size];
    }

    template<typename T, typename... Args>
    T* allocate(Args&&... args) {
        size_t alignment = alignof(T);
        size_t aligned_used = (used + alignment - 1) & ~(alignment - 1);
        
        if (aligned_used + sizeof(T) > size) {
            throw std::bad_alloc();
        }
        
        T* obj = new(memory + aligned_used) T(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
        used = aligned_used + sizeof(T);
        return obj;
    }

    ~NodeArena() {
        delete[] memory;
    }
};
```

2. **Memory Pooling**
   - Group allocations of similar-sized objects
   - Implement freelists for frequently allocated/deallocated types

3. **Reference Counting vs. Garbage Collection**
   - Consider implementing a simple reference counting system
   - For batch processing, consider region-based memory management

### Memory Usage Reduction

1. **Compact Data Structures**
   - Use bit fields for boolean flags
   - Consider using uint16_t or smaller types when appropriate

2. **String Interning**
   - Share string data across the compiler
   - Keep a table of unique strings to avoid duplication

3. **Lazy Computation**
   - Defer expensive operations until results are needed
   - Cache computed results for reuse

## Benchmarking and Profiling

### Performance Testing

1. **Targeted Benchmarks**
   - Create specific benchmarks for each compiler stage
   - Measure performance on realistic code samples of different sizes

2. **Profiling Tools**
   - Use CPU profilers to identify hotspots
   - Track memory allocation patterns

3. **Continuous Performance Testing**
   - Integrate performance tests into the development workflow
   - Maintain a performance dashboard to track changes over time

### Memory Profiling

1. **Heap Analysis**
   - Track memory allocations and deallocations
   - Identify memory leaks and excessive allocations

2. **Stack Usage**
   - Monitor stack depth during parsing
   - Optimize recursive functions that may cause stack overflow

## Trade-offs

### Time vs. Space Considerations

1. **Caching Trade-offs**
   - Caching results trades memory for speed
   - Consider configurable cache sizes based on available memory

2. **Compilation Stages**
   - Optimize the bottleneck stage first (often parsing)
   - Consider separating stages for incremental compilation

3. **Development vs. Production**
   - Provide debug modes with more memory usage but better diagnostics
   - Optimize release builds for performance

### Implementation Complexity

1. **Maintainability Considerations**
   - Balance optimization complexity against maintainability
   - Document optimization techniques thoroughly
   - Use benchmarks to justify complex optimizations

2. **Platform-Specific Optimizations**
   - Consider SIMD instructions for lexing on supported platforms
   - Use memory mapping and OS-specific features when available

## Conclusion

Optimization is an ongoing process that requires careful measurement and targeted improvements. By applying these techniques at each stage of the compilation pipeline, we can significantly improve both the time and space complexity of our JavaScript compiler.

Remember that premature optimization can lead to unnecessary complexity, so always profile first to identify the true bottlenecks before implementing optimizations.
